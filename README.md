# Tibbo Remote-IO
Tibbo Remote IO solution allows you to monitor and control the state of digital and analog lines of Tibbo Remote IO controllers, and also to monitor external sensors connected to Remote IO Controllers.

Built on the Tibbo Project System (TPS) platform, Remote IO Controllers are infinitely flexible, as the majority of their capabilities come from installed Tibbit blocks. Need an extra input or output, or want to connect an additional sensor? Add the right Tibbit!

Remote IO Controllers run a dedicated open-source firmware application. This application allows you to define the configuration of your Controller, i.e., describe what Tibbit modules are installed, what external sensors are connected, and so on. After the setup is complete, you can use any standard Modbus master device, Modbus software client, or SCADA software to monitor and set the IO lines of the Controller, as well as to monitor external sensors connected to it. The Remote IO app is also compatible with our AggreGate server. SNMP support will be added in the near future.

Tibbo Remote IO solution targets SCADA, as well as distributed control and data collection applications.
